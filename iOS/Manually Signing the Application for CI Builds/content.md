# Manually Signing the Application for CI Builds

As part of Xcode 8 features, Apple introduced automatically code signing during and there's a whole [WWDC session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/401/) about it. There were several issues due to code signing and provisioning the application before Xcode 8 and the error messages mostly weren't much useful to narrow down the issue. I remember there were many times that I could even successfully make a build of my application, but it was crashing right on the start up and after spending hours over it, it was due to some entitlement mismatch issues. Many of these issues are resolved in Xcode 8 with better error messages and also automating many of the steps. All of these new features work great and if you're managing a CI build, as far as you're not overriding the default bundle identifier, this shouldn't affect your build script. However, if you do use overriding bundle identifiers based on the build requested (enterprise vs. App store) then your build script starts failing on Xcode 8. This post is about the solution I found for this issue that worked for ours and hopefully it helps another person to save some time if they've having similar issue.
